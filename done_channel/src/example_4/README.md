## Example 4: Graceful Cancellation with Context

In this act, the "Done Channel Pattern" takes a subtle backseat, and the spotlight shines on the `context.Context` with a graceful cancellation mechanism.

The performance unfolds as follows:

1. The `request` function takes center stage, mimicking an asynchronous operation that gracefully takes its time, around 5 seconds, to complete its act. This operation is a master of its own destiny, in tune with the melody of the provided `context.Context`.

2. The grand overture begins in the `main` function, where a `context` is gracefully crafted using `context.WithCancel(context.Background())`. This artful creation enables the cancellation of the context when the time is right. A `defer cancel()` statement gracefully ensures that the context can be canceled, an essential plot point. However, the true magic lies in the explicit cancellation that unfolds later in the code.

3. A buffered channel named `result` steps onto the stage to collect the outcome of the `request` operation.

4. A skillful goroutine takes its place in the ensemble, entrusted with executing the `request` function. The backdrop to this performance is the provided context `ctx`, serving as a guide for the operation. Upon a successful completion, the result takes a bow and is delivered to the `result` channel. If an error emerges or the context is canceled, the performance acknowledges the situation with an error message but does not linger indefinitely.

5. The main plot of the code relies on a `select` statement, patiently awaiting one of two potential outcomes:
   - If a result gracefully emerges from the depths of the `result` channel, it is celebrated and presented to the audience.
   - If a duration of one second passes in solemn silence (as indicated by `time.After(time.Second)`), a mysterious message, "request timeout," graces the stage.

6. After the waiting game for either a result or a timeout, the grand finale unfolds with the dramatic call of `cancel()`. This is the cue for the `context` to gracefully exit, concluding its performance.

7. As the curtain begins to descend, a brief intermission with `time.Sleep` introduces a moment of reflection, allowing the sub-goroutine to share its final message, a parting note before the lights dim. While not a direct element of the "Done Channel Pattern," this interlude serves as a delicate waiting mechanism, reminding us that in the world of concurrency, even the subtlest details play their roles.

In this code, the `context.Context` gracefully assumes the role of signaling and gracefully canceling the operation, much like a done channel in the "Done Channel Pattern." The difference lies in the finesse of cancellation, emphasizing clean and timely completion, a crucial element in the symphony of concurrent performances.
