# Concurrency Patterns in Golang

Here are 6 popular concurrency patterns in Golang, each represented by a unique color and icon for visual clarity:

1. 🟢 **The Done Channel Pattern**: This pattern is used for signaling the completion of goroutines through a special "done" channel. It allows for effective synchronization and coordination in concurrent operations.

2. 🔵 **The Fan-In Pattern**: The Fan-In pattern enables the combination of data from multiple channels into one, making it useful for collecting and processing results from various sources.

3. 🟡 **The Fan-Out Pattern**: With the Fan-Out pattern, data is distributed to multiple goroutines for parallel processing, optimizing throughput and resource utilization.

4. 🟣 **Sharding**: Sharding is a pattern used to distribute data among multiple goroutines or nodes in distributed systems. It allows for scalable data management and parallel access.

5. 🔴 **Bounded Parallelism**: Bounded Parallelism is a pattern that limits the number of concurrently executing goroutines, helping to manage system load and resource consumption.

6. 🟠 **Backpressure**: Backpressure is a pattern that controls the flow of data within a system to prevent overloading handlers and ensure smooth and efficient data processing.

These patterns provide essential tools for building concurrent and scalable applications in Golang, enhancing performance and resource management. Incorporate these patterns into your code for efficient and reliable concurrent operations.
