## Example 3:

The "Fan-Out" pattern, which efficiently distributes data from a source channel (`src`) to multiple worker goroutines through destination channels. Here's how it operates:

1. The `FanOutWithWaitGroup` function accepts a source channel (`src`) and the desired number of destination channels (`n`). It returns a slice of these destination channels, which will be used for distributing data.

2. The function creates an array of destination channels (`dests`) and launches `n` goroutines, each associated with one destination channel. These channels are used to distribute data from the source channel to the workers.

3. Inside each worker goroutine, there's a `for` loop that reads data from the source channel and forwards it to the respective destination channel. The worker goroutines defer closing their destination channels to ensure proper termination.

4. In the `main` function, a source channel (`src`) is created to hold integer values from 1 to 10.

5. A goroutine populates the source channel with values, and it is deferred to close the source channel when finished.

6. The `FanOutWithWaitGroup` function is called with the source channel and the number of desired destination channels (`n`), which is set to 5 in this case.

7. A `sync.WaitGroup` (`wg`) is employed to ensure that the `main` function waits for all worker goroutines to complete.

8. For each destination channel generated by `FanOutWithWaitGroup`, a worker goroutine is initiated. These worker goroutines read data from their corresponding destination channels and print it, including the worker's index and the data.

9. After initiating the worker goroutines, the program waits for all workers to complete using `wg.Wait()`.

In summary, the "Fan-Out" pattern efficiently divides data from a source channel to multiple worker goroutines for concurrent processing. It is a practical approach for parallelize work and making the most of available resources.
