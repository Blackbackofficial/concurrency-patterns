The Sharding pattern can be useful in various scenarios for solving problems related to data distribution and parallel processing. Here are a few basic situations where Sharding can be useful in Go:

1. **Parallel data processing**: Go was originally developed to support parallel operations using goroutines. Sharding allows you to efficiently distribute tasks between gorutins and data shards, which contributes to easy and efficient parallelism.

2. **Load Balancing**: Sharding can be used to load balance between different shards or mountains. This is especially important in high-load systems in order to distribute requests evenly and avoid overloads.

3. **Caching**: In Go, caching is often used to speed up data access. Sharding can be used to manage cached data and provide quick access to it from different goroutines.

4. **Data storage and access**: In Go, you can use Sharding to efficiently store and access data such as configurations, sessions, or other data that needs quick access from multiple locations in the application.

5. **Distributed systems**: In the development of distributed systems where data and tasks can be shared between multiple nodes or services, Sharding plays an important role in the separation and coordination of data and tasks between different components.

6. **Resource Optimization**: Sharding allows efficient use of resources, such as memory and processor time, by distributing data and tasks to different shards or goroutines.


### Example 1:
Demonstrates the "Sharding" pattern for efficient data distribution among shards, enabling parallel access and management.

### Example 2:
Applies "Sharding" to create a sharded storage for distributed data, ensuring even distribution and thread-safe access.

### Example 3:
Shows the use of "Sharding" for data distribution using a simple hash, supporting parallel processing.

### Example 4:
Illustrates "Sharding" for load balancing and request distribution, ensuring even allocation of requests.

### Example 5:
Like Example 4, but with a focus on thread safety using mutexes for concurrent access.
