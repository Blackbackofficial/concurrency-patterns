The "Bounded Parallelism" pattern is useful when you want to limit the number of concurrent operations to prevent resource exhaustion, such as excessive memory or CPU usage. It's a common approach in scenarios where there's a need to control and optimize the concurrency of tasks, especially when dealing with limited resources.


### Example 1:

**Bounded Parallelism** limits concurrent operations using a semaphore. It prevents system overload and ensures efficient processing.

### Example 2:

In web scraping, **Limited Concurrency** prevents overloading websites, improves efficiency, and avoids server overload by controlling concurrent requests (e.g., 5 requests at a time).
