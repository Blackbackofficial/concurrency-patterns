The "Bounded Parallelism" pattern serves as a valuable tool for constraining the number of simultaneous operations, preventing the exhaustion of resources like excessive memory or CPU usage. It's a widely adopted strategy in scenarios demanding careful concurrency control and optimization of task execution, particularly when confronted with resource limitations.

### Example 1: Applying Bounded Parallelism

**Bounded Parallelism** is effectively employed in this example by using a semaphore to limit concurrent operations. By doing so, it mitigates the risk of system overload and ensures efficient processing.

### Example 2: Managing Web Scraping

In the context of web scraping, employing **Limited Concurrency** is pivotal. This approach safeguards websites from overloading, enhances efficiency, and circumvents server strain by governing the number of concurrent requests (e.g., allowing only 5 requests to be processed at any given time).
