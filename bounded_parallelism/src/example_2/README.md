## Example 2: Efficient Web-Scraping with Limited Concurrency

Imagine you're tasked with the mission of collecting valuable information from various websites. To expedite this data collection operation, you opt for a parallel approach, concurrently scanning multiple websites. But, you're also cautious, keen on not overwhelming network resources or the servers hosting these sites. Here's where the "Limited Concurrency" pattern steps in as your trusty ally.

You employ the "Limited Concurrency" pattern to exert control over the number of concurrent HTTP requests to these websites. In practice, you set a limit, perhaps five concurrent requests, ensuring your web scraper never bombards these sites with more than five requests simultaneously. This strategic decision bestows several advantages upon your mission:

1. **Efficient Parallel Data Collection**:
    - With this approach, you can swiftly gather data from multiple websites concurrently. The pattern empowers you to perform tasks in parallel, significantly expediting the overall process.

2. **Safeguarding Website Servers**:
    - Your foresight pays off as you prevent the websites' servers from being overwhelmed. By not inundating them with too many requests simultaneously, you ensure that these servers continue to operate smoothly, free from excessive strain.

3. **Resource Efficiency**:
    - Notably, you're conscientious about resource management. By avoiding the creation of too many parallel goroutines, you steer clear of excessive memory consumption. This calculated resource efficiency underlines the brilliance of the "Limited Concurrency" pattern in action.

In summary, the "Limited Concurrency" pattern emerges as your reliable companion in the quest for efficient web-scraping. It empowers you to gather data swiftly, safeguard website servers, and maintain resource efficiency, all while orchestrating a harmonious and balanced symphony of concurrent requests.
