The "backpressure" pattern is used to manage data flows and resources, prevent overloading and ensure more flexible operation of systems. Here are some examples of the application of this pattern:

1. Limitation of the number of simultaneously executed tasks:
    - In the example you gave, "backpressure" limits the number of simultaneously executed HTTP requests to the server in order to avoid server overload and effectively manage resources.

2. Working with gorutin pools:
    - When creating a pool of goroutines to perform tasks, "backpressure" can be used to limit the number of goroutines that are actively performing tasks. This avoids creating too many goroutines, which can lead to excessive consumption of resources.

3. Restricting access to shared resources:
    - "Backpressure" can be applied to restrict access to shared resources such as databases or caches. This allows you to manage access and avoid conflicts when multiple gorutins are accessed at the same time.

4. Event handling management:
    - In systems that work with events (for example, processing messages from queues), "backpressure" can be used to control the speed of event processing. This prevents event queues from overflowing and ensures a more stable system behavior.

5. Managing data flows in streaming processing:
    - In data streaming applications, "backpressure" can be used to control data flows. For example, when reading and processing data from sources, "backpressure" helps to balance the load and avoid overload at a high data rate.

In each of these cases, the "backpressure" pattern in Go allows you to manage data flows and resources more efficiently, ensuring reliable and stable operation of systems.
